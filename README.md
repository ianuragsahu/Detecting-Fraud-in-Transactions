# Detecting-Fraud-in-Transactions
Our project tackles the business question of addressing the scarcity of financial datasets in mobile money transactions for improved fraud detection methods. The approach involves examining a synthetic dataset to understand normal transactions, utilizing analytics and machine learning to identify anomalies and distinguish potential fraud. Visualization aids in identifying patterns, enhancing fraud detection models, and understanding mobile money dynamics. The objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a synthetic mobile money dataset from the PaySim simulator, aiming to understand legitimate transaction patterns and enhance fraudulent behavior detection within the dataset.
